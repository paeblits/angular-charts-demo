###Introduction
This is a demo application and a possible starting point for our senior design project. I utilize Angular Seed version 0.1, Google Charts, and Bootstrap 3. Heavily inspired by this repo: https://github.com/jay3dec/drunken-octo-ironman

###Installation
1. Clone this repo or create a pull request if you will be contributing.
2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). This is how the app is currently served.
3. Navigate to the repo directory you just cloned (*angular-charts-demo*) on your machine and run the command:
`node scripts/web-server.js`
to start the http server at `http://localhost:8000/`.
4. Go to `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html` in your web browser to view the application.

###Notes
This app utilizes an older version of [Angular Seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed). The reason for this is that the newest version has been heavily modified. It is possible to update to the newest version of Seed but that will require more Angular expertise and possibly heavy refactoring.
